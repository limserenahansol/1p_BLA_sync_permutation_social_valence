# 1p_BLA_sync_permutation_social_valence
code for BLA neuron calcium imaging analysis 
1. you need to preprocessing using core_codes to synchronize the extracted behavior statistics with calcium traces (The TTL emission-reception delay is negligible (less than 30ms), therefore the behavioral statistics time series can be synchronized with calcium traces by the emission/receival time on both devices).
2. then try to download Demo_data for each code; 1. Figure4_food, 2. Figure5_social, 3. Figure5_fear_conditioning, 4. suppl.fig10_longitudinal_footshock_social.
3. You can run each code (4 codes) described in the paper to generate the results.
4. the percentage comparison with shuffling of data in Figure4-5 as bar graph you can reproduce using the code: Figure4_5_permutation_bargraph.
